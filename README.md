# Learning Log

This repository is a personal learning log where I document concepts I’m studying as a software development student.

The goal is to:
- Reinforce my understanding by writing things in my own words
- Keep track of what I’ve learned
- Build a consistent GitHub contribution habit

## Topics
- Blockchain fundamentals
- Computer science basics
- Programming languages

Notes are added incrementally as I study.
